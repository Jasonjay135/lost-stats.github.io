# Quantile Regression
  
Quantile Regression is an extension of linear regression analysis. Quantile Regression differs from OLS in how it estimates the response variable. OLS estimates the conditional mean of $$Y$$ across the predictor variables ($$X_1, X_2, X_3...$$), whereas quantile regression estimates the conditional median (or quantiles) of $$Y$$ across the predictor variables ($$X_1, X_2, X_3...$$). It is useful in situations where OLS assumptions are not met (heteroskedasticity, bi-modal or skewed distributions). To specify the desired quantile, select a $$\tau$$ value between 0 to 1 (.5 gives the median).

## Keep in Mind
  
- This method allows for the dependent variable to have any distributional form, however it cannot be a dummy variable and must be continuous.
- This method is robust to outliers, so there is no need to remove outlier observations.
- Either the intercept term or at least one predictor is required to run an analysis.
- [LASSO]({{ "/Machine_Learning/penalized_regression.html" | relative_url }}) regression cannot be used for feature selection in this framework due to it requiring OLS assumptions to be satisfied.
- This method does not restrict the use of polynomial or interaction terms. A unique functional form can be specified.
  
## Also Consider
  
- While Quantile Regression can be useful in applications where OLS assumptions are not met, it can actually be used to detect heteroskedasticity. This makes is a useful tool to ensure this assumption is met for OLS.
- Several different standard error calculations can be used with this method, however [bootstrapped standard errors]({{ "/Model_Estimation/Statistical_Inference/Nonstandard_Errors/bootstrap_se.html" }}) are generally the best for complex modeling situations. [Clustered standard errors]({{ "/Model_Estimation/Statistical_Inference/Nonstandard_Errors/clustered_se.html" | relative_url }}) are also possible by estimating a quantile regression with pooled OLS clustered errors.
  
# Implementations
  
## Python  
  
The `quantreg` function in **statsmodels** allows for quantile regression.

```python
import statsmodels.api as sm
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf

mtcars = sm.datasets.get_rdataset("mtcars", "datasets").data

mod = smf.quantreg('mpg ~ cyl + hp + wt', mtcars)
# Specify the quantile when you fit
res = mod.fit(q=.2)
print(res.summary())
```
  
## R

The main package to implement Quantile Regression in R is through the `quantreg` package. The main function in this package is `qr()`, which fits a Quantile Regression model with a default $$\tau$$ value of .5 but can be changed.

```r
# Load package
library(quantreg)

# Load data
data(mtcars)

# Run quantile regression with mpg as outcome variable
# and cyl, hp, and wt as predictors
# Using a tau value of .2 for quantiles
quantreg_model = rq(mpg ~ cyl + hp + wt, data = mtcars, tau = .2)

# Look at results
summary(quantreg_model)
```

## Stata

Quantile regression can be performed in Stata using the `qreg` function. By default it fits a median (`q(.5)`). See `help qreg` for some variants, including a bootstrapped quantile regression `bsqreg`.

```stata
sysuse auto
qreg mpg price trunk weight, q(.2)
```
